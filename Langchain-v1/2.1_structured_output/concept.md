In Langchain, **structured output** refers to the practice of having language models return responses in a well-defined data format (for example, [JSON](https://www.json.org/)), rather than free-form text. This makes it easier for the model to parse and process the response, and for the user to extract the relevant information.


TypeDict is a way to define a dictionay in python where you specify what keys and values should exist. It helps ensuere that your dictionary follows a specific structure.

Why use TypeDict?
- It helps ensure that your dictionary follows a specific structure, and that it is easy to understand and maintain.
- It tells Python what keys are required and what types of values thay should have.
- It does not validate data at runtime(it just helps with type hints for better coding)
